# Data Visualisation - Cruise Group[link text](https:// [link text](https://))
These visualisation codes show visualization modules by Seaborn and Matplotlib of Python. The codes were written by Cruise Group of RMIT University. If you want to run the codes, you need to install some other Python libraries in addition to Seaborn and Matplotlib, which have been marked in the codes section. Please refer to the following contents for details. If you're not into reading lenghty explanations at all, feel free to jump right into the commented code.

## Area Chart[link text](https:// [link text](https://))
By coloring the area between the axis and the line, the area map not only emphasizes the peaks and valleys, but also emphasizes the duration of the high and low points. The longer the high point lasts, the larger the area under the line.
- Multi-item area chart
- Separate multi-item area chart

## Box Plot[link text](https:// [link text](https://))
A box plot or boxplot is a method for graphically depicting groups of numerical data through their quartiles. Displays the five-number summary of a set of data. The five-number summary is the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum.
- Multi-item box plot

## Bubble Plot[link text](https:// [link text](https://))
A bubble chart is a variation of a scatter chart in which the data points are replaced with bubbles, and an additional dimension of the data is represented in the size of the bubbles. Just like a scatter chart, a bubble chart does not use a category axis â€” both horizontal and vertical axes are value axes.
- Single item bubble plot
- Multi-item bubble plot with categorical colors
- Bubble plot with a color map

## Heatmap[link text](https:// [link text](https://))
A heatmap is a graphical representation of data where the individual values contained in a matrix are represented as colors. 
- Heatmap with values in blue to yellow colours
- Heatmap with values in blue colours

## Histogram[link text](https:// [link text](https://))
A histogram is a graphical display of data using bars of different heights. In a histogram, each bar groups numbers into ranges. Taller bars show that more data falls in that range. A histogram displays the shape and spread of continuous sample data.
- Single item histogram with a density curve
- Multi-item histogram with density curves

## Line Chart[link text](https:// [link text](https://))
A line chart or line plot or line graph or curve chart is a type of chart which displays information as a series of data points called 'markers' connected by straight line segments. It is a basic type of chart common in many fields.
- Multi-item line chart with categorical colours and marks

## Pie Chart[link text](https:// [link text](https://))
A pie chart is the classic way of displaying composition. However, it is generally not recommended now because sometimes the area of the pie would be misleading. Therefore, if you want to use a pie chart, it is highly recommended to explicitly note the percentage or number of each part in the pie chart.
- Pie chart with percentage marked on
- Circle chart with percentage marked on

## Pyramid Chart[link text](https:// [link text](https://))
The pyramid can be used to show the distribution of groups sorted by number, or it can be used to show the step-by-step filtering of the population.
- Population pyramid with two groups
- Population pyramid with values marked on
- Pyramid with values marked on

## Radar Chart[link text](https:// [link text](https://))
A radar chart is a graphical method of displaying multivariate data in the form of a two-dimensional chart of three or more quantitative variables represented on axes starting from the same point. The relative position and angle of the axes is typically uninformative.
- Radar chart with two groups

## Scatter Plot[link text](https:// [link text](https://))
A scatter plot is a basic chart used to study the relationship between two variables. If you have multiple groups in your data, you might want to visualize each group in a different color.
- Scatter plot with multiple colors
- Scatter plot with categorical colours in multi groups
- Pairwise plot with histogram
- Pairwise plot with categorical colours and marks
